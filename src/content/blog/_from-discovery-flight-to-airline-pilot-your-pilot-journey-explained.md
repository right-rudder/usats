Many pilots remember their **Discovery Flight** as the moment everything changed. That short introductory lesson often becomes the first step toward a rewarding career in aviation. But what happens after that?

Here’s a clear overview of the **pilot journey** — from that very first flight to your first job as an airline pilot.

## Step 1: Discovery Flight

Your journey starts with an unforgettable experience in the cockpit. A [**Discovery Flight with USATS**](/contact-us) gives you control of the aircraft alongside an instructor, helping you decide whether flying is right for you.

## Step 2: Private Pilot License (PPL)

Once you’re ready, the next step is earning your **Private Pilot License**, where you learn the fundamentals of flight, navigation, and safety. USATS uses **modern, well-maintained aircraft** for a hands-on learning experience.

## Step 3: Instrument Rating (IR)

The Instrument Rating builds your confidence and skill by training you to fly safely in low visibility and challenging conditions. It’s an essential step for anyone pursuing a professional pilot career.

## Step 4: Commercial Pilot License (CPL)

Earning your **Commercial Pilot License** opens doors to flying professionally. [**USATS Flight Training Programs**](/airplane-training) provide a structured, FAA Part 141-certified curriculum that’s respected worldwide.

## Step 5: Build Flight Hours

After obtaining your CPL, most pilots build flight experience as instructors, charter pilots, or through structured time-building programs.

## Step 6: Airline Career Opportunities

Once you’ve met the necessary flight hour requirements, you can pursue airline or charter positions. USATS supports graduates with career guidance and connections in the industry.

## Final Thoughts

From a simple [**Discovery Flight**](/contact-us) to a career flying professionally, your path as a pilot is clear and achievable with the right school. [**USATS**](https://usats.training) provides the training, support, and community you need to make it happen.
